# Metal golden-image test

## `camera_pose.png` — scripted-camera pose (Slice AA, interactive runtime)

`camera_pose.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --camera <yaw,pitch,x,y,z> <out>`:
the SAME integrated capstone scene (HDR-IBL environment + truck + skinned-blend fox + PBR helmet +
settled physics pyramid + sorted glass, lit + shadowed + bloom), but framed by the **backend-agnostic
`hf::runtime::Camera`** (Slice AA) at an arbitrary scripted pose instead of the fixed capstone camera.
This golden-verifies the new `Camera` math (yaw/pitch → forward/right/up, `View()`/`Proj()`/`ViewProj()`)
through the real `viewProj → render` path on Metal — the same `Camera` the Vulkan `--camera-shot`
headless capture and the windowed `--fly` viewport use. The golden was baked at pose
`0.2,-0.1,0,3,10` (yaw 0.2 rad, pitch −0.1 rad, eye (0,3,10)). The camera math is pure C++ in
`engine/runtime/camera.h`; the scene/light/bloom are byte-identical to `--capstone`, so the camera is
the only variable. When NO pose is supplied the `--capstone` path uses the original fixed camera, so
`capstone.png` (and every other golden) still diffs `0.0000`. Deterministic — two `--camera` runs diff
`0.0000`. The interactive windowed `--fly` loop is Windows/Vulkan only this slice; windowed Metal
(SDL Metal view + present loop) is a known separate gap and is intentionally NOT attempted here.

## `capstone.png` — integrated capstone showcase (Slice Z)

`capstone.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --capstone`: ONE composed,
deterministic frame that **orchestrates every prior per-feature showcase into a single coherent
scene** — both a milestone demo and an INTEGRATION TEST. Under the **HDR equirect environment**
(`sky_hdr` background + IBL source) sit, on one ground plane: the imported **CesiumMilkTruck**
(`LoadGltfScene`, node hierarchy + deduped PBR materials, `lit_pbr`), the GPU-skinned **Fox** at a
fixed 50/50 **Walk(t=0.3)+Run(t=0.2) blend** (`lit_skinned` + `BlendAnimations`), the full-PBR
**DamagedHelmet** reflecting the environment (`lit_pbr_ibl`) on a pedestal cube, a **settled physics
sphere pyramid** (3-layer pile stepped 240× @ dt=1/120, instanced lit pipeline), and — in front —
two sorted **translucent glass spheres** (`transparent` pipeline, `depthWrite=false`). All opaque
geometry casts into ONE directional shadow map (static + skinned + instanced shadow pipelines), and
the whole scene renders into an **HDR `RGBA16_Float` target** finished by the same bloom chain as
`--bloom` (prefilter → 5 down → up → composite/tonemap).

This is the integration value: **7 distinct opaque pipelines + a transparent pipeline**, each with a
different descriptor set (frame UBO, 2-tex material, 5-tex PBR set, environment, joint palette,
instance buffer), coexist in ONE scene render pass — exercising descriptor-set / pipeline-state /
push-constant coexistence that no isolated showcase hits. It reuses every existing pipeline / shader /
loader; **nothing existing is touched**, so all 12 prior goldens still diff `0.0000`. The scene is
fully deterministic (fixed camera/light, fixed transforms, fixed physics step budget + fox blend
times) — two `--capstone` runs diff `0.0000`. The construction mirrors the Vulkan `--capstone-shot`
path byte-for-byte (only the CPU NDC-Y flip differs).

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh

## `ssao.png` — screen-space ambient occlusion (Slice Y)

`ssao.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --ssao`: the SAME settled physics
sphere-pyramid scene as `--physics` (ground checkerboard + procedural sky + the 30 resting spheres,
lit + shadowed), rendered into an HDR (RGBA16F) target, PLUS classic **screen-space ambient
occlusion**. A dedicated **g-buffer prepass** (`gbuffer.vert`/`gbuffer_instanced.vert` +
`gbuffer.frag`) writes the **view-space normal (xyz) + view-space linear depth (w)** into an RGBA16F
target; an **SSAO pass** (`ssao.frag`) reconstructs each pixel's view-space position from the linear
depth + projection params (no matrix inverse), orients a baked **16-sample hemisphere kernel** to the
surface via a TBN from a tiled rotation noise (kernel + noise are BAKED CONSTANTS — no runtime RNG),
samples neighbour depths with a smooth range check, and writes an AO factor; a **4×4 box blur**
(`ssao_blur.frag`) removes the kernel noise; and a **composite** (`ssao_composite.frag`) multiplies
the lit scene by the blurred AO then applies the same exposure/ACES/grade/vignette as `post.frag`.
The AO visibly darkens the contact crevices where spheres touch each other and the ground while flat
open surfaces stay bright — localized contact AO, not a global dim. SEPARATE pipelines + shaders; no
existing pipeline/shader/golden is touched. Deterministic — two `--ssao` runs diff `0.0000`.

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh

## `anim_blend.png` — animation blending (Slice X)

`anim_blend.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --blend`: the SAME scene/camera/light
as `--skinning` (ground checkerboard + procedural sky + the GPU-skinned Fox, lit + shadowed), but the
joint palette is a **50/50 cross-clip blend** of the Fox's `"Walk"` (t=0.3s) and `"Run"` (t=0.2s)
clips instead of a single-clip sample. The blend is pure CPU-side C++ in `hf::anim`: each clip is
sampled into a local pose (`SampleLocalPose`), the two poses are blended per joint
(`BlendLocalPoses`: lerp translation/scale, slerp rotation), and the blended pose is composed into the
matrix palette (`PaletteFromLocalPose`) — `BlendAnimations` chains these. NO RHI/backend/shader change:
it feeds the existing skinned lit + shadow pipeline exactly like `--skinning`. The blended pose is a
clearly intermediate four-legged locomotion stance, visibly distinct from either pure clip and from
the near-static `"Survey"` pose used by `--skinning`. Deterministic — two `--blend` runs diff `0.0000`.
This golden is INDEPENDENT of all the others; the `SampleAnimation` refactor that introduced the
local-pose step is byte-identical, so `skinning.png` (and every other golden) still diffs `0.0000`.

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh
./build-metal/visual_test --blend /tmp/blend.png
~/mac-remote-rig/compare.sh tests/golden/metal/anim_blend.png /tmp/blend.png 0.0   # -> DIFF 0.0000
```

## `debug_viz.png` — immediate-mode debug visualization (Slice W)

`debug_viz.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --debug`: the SAME settled physics
sphere-pyramid scene as `--physics` (ground checkerboard + procedural sky + the 30-body pile, lit +
shadowed), with an immediate-mode **debug-draw overlay** rendered on top — a ground grid, a colored
wireframe **AABB** hugging each settled body, a per-body **wire sphere**, a directional-**light
arrow**, and **physics contact** markers (crosses + normal stubs). The overlay is built CPU-side by
the pure-C++ `hf::debug::DebugDraw` collector (each shape decomposes to LINE_LIST segments) and drawn
as ONE non-indexed `Draw` through a new debug-line pipeline.

New RHI: `GraphicsPipelineDesc.lineList` (default false) → `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_LINE_LIST` on
Vulkan / `MTLPrimitiveTypeLine` selected at draw time on Metal. The debug pipeline is
`lineList=true, usesFrameUniforms=true, depthTest=true, depthWrite=false`, so the lines are correctly
**occluded** by opaque geometry in front but never fight the depth buffer; it draws AFTER the opaque
spheres in the scene pass. The line MSL is generated from the shared HLSL (`shaders/debug_line.{vert,
frag}.hlsl`) by the build toolchain (`debug_line.vert.gen.metal` entry `debug_line_vertex`,
`debug_line.frag.gen.metal` entry `debug_line_fragment`). `lineList` defaults false so every
pre-existing pipeline is byte-for-byte unchanged: all nine other goldens still diff `0.0000`.
Deterministic — two `--debug` runs diff `0.0000`. This golden is INDEPENDENT of all the others.

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh
./build-metal/visual_test --debug /tmp/dbg.png
~/mac-remote-rig/compare.sh tests/golden/metal/debug_viz.png /tmp/dbg.png 0.0   # -> DIFF 0.0000
```

---

## `bloom.png` — HDR bloom (Slice U)

`bloom.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --bloom`: the same HDR-IBL helmet scene as
`--ibl`, but rendered into an **HDR `RGBA16_Float` render target** so highlights keep values >1, then
run through a true bloom chain — a soft-knee **threshold** bright-pass, a 5-level progressively
half-res **downsample** mip chain (13-tap COD/Jimenez dual filter), a 3×3 tent-filter
**upsample/combine** back up, and a **composite** that adds the bloom and applies the *same*
exposure/ACES/grade/grain/vignette as `post.frag`, writing the LDR swapchain. The HDR sun and the
helmet's emissive cyan gauge bloom (soft halo); the rest of the frame stays sharp.

New RHI: `IRHIDevice::CreateRenderTarget(w, h, Format)` (the 2-arg overload delegates with
`Format::Undefined` → swapchain format, byte-for-byte unchanged); `GraphicsPipelineDesc.fragmentPushConstants`
(widens the push-constant range to VERTEX|FRAGMENT so the fullscreen bloom passes read per-pass params
in the fragment stage — default false leaves every existing pipeline's layout unchanged); and
`ICommandBuffer::BindTexturePair(primary, secondary)` (binds two sampled images into one material set —
base slot + the second/normal slot — so the composite samples HDR scene + bloom together). On Metal the
RT uses `MTLPixelFormatRGBA16Float`; the bloom MSL is generated from the shared HLSL (`bloom_*.frag.hlsl`)
and the fragment push constant binds at `kFbPushConst=1`. Deterministic — two `--bloom` runs diff
`0.0000`. This golden is INDEPENDENT of all the others, which are unchanged (all still diff `0.0000`).

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh
./build-metal/visual_test --bloom /tmp/bloom.png
~/mac-remote-rig/compare.sh tests/golden/metal/bloom.png /tmp/bloom.png 0.0   # -> DIFF 0.0000
```

## `ibl_helmet.png` — HDR environment IBL (Slice R)

`ibl_helmet.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --ibl`: a minimal HDR
image-based-lighting showcase (HDR **equirectangular** skybox + ground checkerboard plane + the
DamagedHelmet shaded so its metal reflects the **real captured sky/sun/terrain**, lit + shadowed,
fixed camera/light). The environment is `assets/env/env.hdr` (a CC0 clear-sky 1k equirect), decoded
with `stbi_loadf` and uploaded as an **N-mip `RGBA16_Float`** texture: each coarser mip is a CPU 2×2
box-downsample (progressively blurrier → approximates a roughness-prefiltered specular environment).
The new shaders `shaders/sky_hdr.frag.hlsl` (background, LOD 0) and `shaders/lit_pbr_ibl.frag.hlsl`
(specular = env at `roughness*maxLod`, diffuse irradiance = env at a very high mip) sample the env
via the equirect mapping `u = atan2(z,x)/2π+0.5, v = acos(y)/π`. The env binds on a DEDICATED slot
(`usesEnvironment` → flat fragment `texture(11)/sampler(12)`, `metal_common.h kFragEnvTex/kFragEnvSmp`)
via `ICommandBuffer::BindEnvironment`, so the existing set 0/1/2 layouts and the golden-locked
`lit`/`sky`/`lit_pbr` pipelines are byte-for-byte unchanged. The frame is deterministic — two runs
diff `0.0000`. This golden is INDEPENDENT of `scene_shadow.png` / `skinning.png` / `pbr_helmet.png` /
`instanced.png`, which are all unchanged (still diff `0.0000`).

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh
./build-metal/visual_test --ibl /tmp/ibl.png
~/mac-remote-rig/compare.sh tests/golden/metal/ibl_helmet.png /tmp/ibl.png 0.0   # -> DIFF 0.0000
```

---

## `instanced.png` — GPU instanced rendering (Slice Q)

`instanced.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --instanced`: a minimal GPU-instancing
showcase (ground checkerboard plane + procedural sky + a **12×12 = 144 field of spheres** drawn in a
single `ICommandBuffer::DrawIndexedInstanced` call, lit + shadowed, fixed elevated camera/light).
Each instance is placed by its own per-instance model matrix supplied through a SECOND, per-instance
vertex stream (RHI binding 1): four `RGBA32_Float` attributes at locations 7–10 carry the columns of
a column-major `float4x4` (`scene::InstanceTransformLayout`, stride 64), bound via
`BindInstanceBuffer`. The transforms come from the deterministic `scene::BuildInstanceGrid` (NO RNG —
a pure function of the instance index: grid x/z + a per-index sin height bob + a per-index Y spin), so
the frame is golden-stable — two runs diff to `0.0000`. The instanced MSL is generated from the
shared HLSL (`shaders/lit_instanced.vert.hlsl` + the unchanged `lit.frag`; the field's shadows use
`shaders/shadow_instanced.vert.hlsl`) by the build toolchain (`lit_instanced.vert.gen.metal`, entry
`instanced_vertex`); the per-instance attributes bind at Metal vertex buffer slot `kVbInstance = 4`
(`metal_common.h`), past vertex(0)/frameUbo(1)/pushConst(2)/jointPalette(3), with the vertex
descriptor's `kVbInstance` layout set to `MTLVertexStepFunctionPerInstance`. This golden is
INDEPENDENT of `scene_shadow.png` / `skinning.png` / `pbr_helmet.png`, which are unchanged (all still
diff `0.0000`) because instancing is an additive separate pipeline + vertex binding.

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh

## `pbr_helmet.png` — full glTF PBR material (Slice P)

`pbr_helmet.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --pbr`: a minimal full-PBR showcase
(ground checkerboard plane + procedural sky + the **DamagedHelmet** glTF model, lit + shadowed,
fixed camera/light). The helmet renders the complete glTF metallic-roughness material set — base
color (sRGB), metallic-roughness (G=roughness, B=metallic), tangent-space normal map, emissive, and
ambient occlusion — through a dedicated **lit-PBR pipeline** (`shaders/lit_pbr.frag.hlsl`, shared
`lit.vert`) and a wider 5-texture material set bound via `ICommandBuffer::BindMaterialPBR`. The
material textures are decoded from the embedded `.glb` images by the shared
`asset::LoadPbrGltfModel`; tangents are computed from POSITION/UV/NORMAL (the asset has no TANGENT).
The MSL is generated from the same HLSL by the build toolchain (`lit_pbr.frag.gen.metal`, entry
`pbr_fragment`); the PBR map indices come from `metal_common.h` (`kFragMetalRoughTex=5`,
`kFragEmissiveTex=7`, `kFragOcclusionTex=9`, + their samplers). Deterministic — two runs diff to
`0.0000`. This golden is INDEPENDENT of `scene_shadow.png` / `skinning.png`, which are unchanged
(both still diff `0.0000`) because the PBR path is an additive separate pipeline + material set.

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh
./build-metal/visual_test --pbr /tmp/pbr.png
~/mac-remote-rig/compare.sh tests/golden/metal/pbr_helmet.png /tmp/pbr.png 0.0   # -> DIFF 0.0000
```

---

`scene_shadow.png` is the golden reference produced by the **real** Metal RHI backend running
headless on an Apple M4 (`metal_headless/visual_test`), rendering the full scene (ground
checkerboard plane + a 3×3 grid mixing 3 shiny metal spheres on the main diagonal with 6 matte
dielectric cubes — the per-material PBR showcase, matching the Vulkan `hello_triangle` scene)
through the complete frame pipeline:
**directional shadow pass → scene into an offscreen render target → fullscreen post (FXAA + glow +
ACES tonemap + cinematic grade + film grain + vignette)**. Deterministic — fixed camera, fixed
light, static transforms, offscreen `MTLTexture` target, byte-exact readback; two runs diff to
`0.0000`.

It exercises the full Metal parity surface through the `IRHIDevice` / `ICommandBuffer` seam — the
same calls the Vulkan `hello_triangle` sample makes: `CreateShadowMap` / `BeginShadowPass` /
`EndShadowPass`, `CreateRenderTarget` / `BeginRenderTargetFrame` / `EndRenderTargetFrame`, the
`fullscreen` post pipeline, per-frame UBO, push-constant model matrix **plus per-material
metallic/roughness** (80-byte vertex push constant: `{ float4x4 model; float4 material; }`), and
PCF shadow sampling.

> **Re-bake (per-material PBR):** this golden was re-baked when per-object metallic/roughness
> landed. The lit shaders now read metallic/roughness from the push constant (passed vertex→fragment
> as a flat `nointerpolation` interpolant) instead of fixed values, so the metal spheres render
> dark/specular-reflective (no diffuse, no env map yet) next to the bright dielectric cubes — a
> legitimate material-driven change. Two runs diff to `0.0000`; Vulkan renders the same variety.

> **Re-bake (procedural IBL):** re-baked again when lightweight image-based lighting landed
> (`lit.frag.hlsl` gained a `SkyColor()` that replicates `sky.frag.hlsl`'s gradient + sun glow, plus
> an environment specular reflection term: roughness-aware Fresnel-Schlick over `reflect(-V, N)`,
> roughness-blurred toward the up-sky, multiplied by F, additive to the direct lights, with a small
> sky-tinted ambient diffuse for dielectrics). The metal spheres now **reflect the procedural sky**
> (shiny) instead of rendering dark, and dielectrics gain a subtle Fresnel sky sheen — a legitimate
> shading change (DIFF 3.4854 vs the previous golden). One shared HLSL change hits both backends;
> two Metal runs diff to `0.0000`, and Vulkan renders the same reflective metals.

> **Re-bake (glTF model):** re-baked again when real glTF model loading landed
> (`engine/asset/gltf_loader.cpp`, header-only `cgltf`). The centre cell of the 3×3 grid is now a
> **real 3D model loaded from `assets/models/Duck.glb`** (Khronos glTF-Sample-Assets, CC0) instead of
> a procedural sphere, rendered through the *same* `scene::Vertex` layout and lit PBR pipeline as a
> fixed metallic material (metallic=1.0, roughness=0.2) so it reflects the procedural sky via IBL —
> polished chrome. Geometry only (POSITION/NORMAL/TEXCOORD_0 + indices); glTF materials/textures
> deferred. One shared loader feeds both backends; two Metal runs diff to `0.0000`, and Vulkan
> renders the same model identically.

> **Re-bake (GPU particles):** re-baked again when the compute-shader GPU particle system landed
> (`shaders/particles.comp.hlsl` + `particle.vert/frag.hlsl`). A compute kernel animates a 50k-particle
> storage buffer each frame (gravity + swirl fountain, deterministic respawn from a stable per-index
> seed), and the particles are drawn as **additive points** over the scene. `visual_test` advances the
> sim a fixed 100 steps at a fixed `dt` before the captured frame, so the fountain is golden-stable —
> two Metal runs diff to `0.0000`. The compute MSL is generated from the shared HLSL exactly like the
> graphics shaders (HLSL → SPIR-V → `kernel` MSL via spirv-cross); Vulkan renders the same fountain.

> **Re-bake (tangent-space normal mapping):** re-baked again when normal mapping landed. The lit
> shader (`shaders/lit.{vert,frag}.hlsl`) now builds a TBN basis from a per-vertex tangent (new
> `scene::Vertex.tangent` at location 4, stride 56) and the interpolated world normal, samples a
> tangent-space normal map, and perturbs the shading normal used by **all** the PBR/IBL/shadow
> lighting. The material descriptor set gained a second sampled image + sampler for the normal map
> (Vulkan set 1 binding 3/4; generated MSL maps it to `gNormalMap [[texture(3)]]` /
> `gNormalSmp [[sampler(4)]]` via `--msl-decoration-binding`, matching `metal_common.h`'s
> `kFragNormalTex`/`kFragNormalSmp`). A procedural domed-tile normal map bumps the dielectric cubes
> + ground plane; the metal spheres and the duck keep a flat (0,0,1) normal. Legitimate shading
> change: **DIFF 0.3283** vs the previous golden. One shared HLSL change hits both backends; two
> Metal runs diff to `0.0000`, and Vulkan renders the same bumps.

## `transparency.png` — alpha-blended transparency (Slice T)

`transparency.png` is a SEPARATE golden produced by `visual_test --transparency`: a minimal
translucent-glass showcase (ground checkerboard plane + procedural sky + three **opaque** lit cubes —
two behind the glass, one in front as an occluder — then **four overlapping tinted glass spheres** at
different depths, lit + shadowed, fixed head-on camera/light). The glass is drawn in a SORTED
(back-to-front by distance from the camera eye) **alpha-blended** pass using a SEPARATE transparent
pipeline (`shaders/transparent.vert.hlsl` + `shaders/transparent.frag.hlsl`): the fragment shader is
self-contained (no material textures) — a directional half-Lambert diffuse + a Blinn-Phong specular
highlight + a procedural `SkyColor` reflection, with a **Fresnel-style alpha** that rises at grazing
angles so edges read as more opaque (`alpha = lerp(baseAlpha, 1, pow(1-N·V, 5))`). Per-object tint +
base alpha arrive via the push constant (`{ float4x4 model; float4 tintAlpha }`, 80 bytes).

The pipeline runs `alphaBlend=true, depthTest=true, depthWrite=false, cullNone=true` (double-sided
glass). The new RHI flag **`GraphicsPipelineDesc.depthWrite`** (default `true`) lets the glass
depth-TEST against the opaque scene (so opaque geometry in front correctly occludes it — see the
front cube) while NOT writing depth (so overlapping glass blends correctly and never self-occludes).
`depthWrite` defaults true, so every pre-existing pipeline is byte-for-byte unchanged: the five
goldens above (`scene_shadow`/`skinning`/`pbr_helmet`/`instanced`/`ibl_helmet`) and `physics` all
still diff `0.0000`. The scene is deterministic (fixed camera, deterministic CPU sort) — two
`--transparency` runs diff `0.0000`. This golden is INDEPENDENT of all the others.

Re-bake / validate the same way as the others:

```sh
./build-metal/visual_test --transparency /tmp/glass.png
~/mac-remote-rig/compare.sh tests/golden/metal/transparency.png /tmp/glass.png 0.0   # -> DIFF 0.0000
```

## Shaders are generated, not hand-written

The Metal shaders are **generated from the shared HLSL sources** at build time — there is no
hand-written MSL to drift from the canonical shaders. The `metal_headless` build runs, for each
shader: HLSL → SPIR-V (`glslc -x hlsl`) → MSL (`spirv-cross --msl --msl-decoration-binding`),
emitting `*.gen.metal`, which `visual_test` compiles at runtime via `newLibraryWithSource:`. The
`--msl-decoration-binding` flag maps each resource's SPIR-V binding directly to its Metal
`[[buffer/texture/sampler(n)]]` index; the engine's Metal binding constants
(`engine/rhi_metal/metal_common.h`) are chosen to match.

> **Re-bake history:** this golden was re-baked from the unified pipeline when the toolchain
> landed. The previous golden had been produced from hand-written MSL that had silently *drifted*
> from the HLSL (it used `ambient 0.15` vs the HLSL's `0.12`, and its post pass omitted the FXAA,
> glow, and film grain that the canonical `post.frag.hlsl` — and the Vulkan backend — apply). The
> generated MSL faithfully reproduces the canonical HLSL, so this golden now matches what Vulkan
> renders semantically. Eliminating exactly that kind of drift is the point of the toolchain.

## How it is produced

```sh
# On the Mac (Command Line Tools only — runtime MSL compile, no Xcode/metal CLI):
source ~/mac-remote-rig/env.sh
cd ~/hazard-forge
cmake -S metal_headless -B build-metal -G Ninja
cmake --build build-metal          # also generates *.gen.metal from the HLSL
./build-metal/visual_test /tmp/out.png
```

## Validate a future run (visual regression)

```sh
./build-metal/visual_test /tmp/out.png
~/mac-remote-rig/compare.sh tests/golden/metal/scene_shadow.png /tmp/out.png 0.0
# -> DIFF 0.0000 (threshold 0.0), exit 0 on a match.
```

A non-zero DIFF means the Metal render changed — investigate before re-baking this golden.

## NDC-Y convention (handled CPU-side)

`math::Perspective` / `math::Ortho` bake the Vulkan clip-space Y-flip (+Y down). Metal NDC is +Y up.
Rather than flip in the shader (which would diverge from the shared HLSL), `visual_test` flips the
projection's and ortho's Y row on the **CPU** before composing view-proj / lightViewProj, so the
shared HLSL→MSL needs no Metal-specific clip flip. The only remaining Metal-specific adjustments are
two *texture-origin* V-flips (Metal stores row 0 = top): the fullscreen-post sample UV and the
shadow-map sample UV — both guarded by `#ifdef HF_MSL_GEN` so the Vulkan SPIR-V is byte-identical.
The shadow render and the lit-pass sampling both derive from the same CPU-flipped `lightViewProj`,
so they stay self-consistent.
